# Gaia 8

The Gaia 8 is an awesome light

With a 4' x 8' coverage area you are able to produce the gnarliest buds ever.

We recommend spacing 6 plants evenly in your area fed with our superferty
during the first 6 weeks of their lives

Then during Bloom try our [Acid Knee Bloomenthal](http://blah)
to really kick things up a notch.  

We'll post some pics soon of comparison buds
