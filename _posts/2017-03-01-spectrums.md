## Blue vs. Red

The Gaia series of lights can accentuate various spectrums for various
stages of growth

### Blooming (Red)

The luscious reds give intense penetrating rays that promote dense bud
growth.  You'll want this for your last stages of growth so that your
buds develope intense aromas, prolific trichome productions, and massive
density.

### Vegetative (Blue)

The Blue spectrum is used early in the plants life and prevents the
plant from getting too "leggy", where the plant in search of blue
skylight will stretch and your distance between nodes becomes too great.
This leads to the plant being too weak to hold itself and requires
splints.  By giving them a boost of blue early on you can prevent much
of this and get a much denser and healthier plant.

### Conventional (White/Yellow)

This is your conventional spectrum.  Much of the light is reflected off
the plant and not even used for photosynthesis.  This leads to wasted
electrical power and poor plant growth.
