#  Chocolope Story

  I bagged up a half pound each of chocolope grown under a tesla light
  and a half pound under the Gaia 8.  And I took it to a connoisseur
  and asked him which would you like?

  He said "the one grown under the Gaia 8 had better fragrance, better
  sparkle, and the buds felt more dense" needless to say he took the
  half pound grown under the Gaia 8.
