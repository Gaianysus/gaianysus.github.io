The Gaia 4 is an awesome light composed of 4 90 Watt high intensity LEDs
and many 5 Watt spectrum LEDs.  Which gives a very full spectrum of light
that includes lot's of blue to keep your plants from getting 'leggy',
and a plenty of red to make your blooms dense and fragrant.
Concentrating on the spectrums your plant absorbs and not the
frequencies it reflects. This means less energy is wasted on light the plant does
not use for photosynthesis and you waste less electricity on producing
light frequencies your plant will never use.

With a 4' x 4' coverage area you are able to produce the gnarliest buds ever.

We recommend spacing 2 plants evenly in your area fed with our superferty
during the first 6 weeks of their lives

Then during Bloom try our [Acid Knee Bloomenthal](http://blah)
to really kick things up a notch.

We'll post some pics soon of comparison buds

#### Eletrical Characteristics

The Gaia 8 includes one master switch to turn the light on or off completely, and three separate dimmers to change the intensity of the Red, Blue, and Hight Intensity LEDs individually so you can fine tune for cloning, vegetative, and flowering stages. An auto switching powersupply is integrated which should be suitable for most power applications. A 90 degree optical glass lens focuses the light coming out of the unit enhancing penetration ensuring quality photosynthesis.  If the unit overheats (>60C) the unit will shut off automatically.

Warnings:  Indoor use only.  Avoid getting the unit wet in any way.  It
should be mounted well above any irrigation equipment.  The plants
should be less than 10 inches from the light or you risk burning the
plant, but it should not be more than 30 inches from the top of your
plants.  The plants should also be misted 2-3 times every day.
