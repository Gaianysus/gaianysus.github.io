#  Chocolope Story

  I bagged up a half pound each of chocolope grown under a tesla light
  and a half pound under the Gaia 8.  And I took it to a connoisseur
  and asked him which would you like?

  He said "the one grown under the Gaia 8 had better fragrance, better
  sparkle, and the buds felt more dense" needless to say he took the
  half pound grown under the Gaia 8.

## Hotspots

Hotspots can be an issue burning leaves and causing flowers to poorly
develop the next picture shows a Infra Red picture of an HID light
showing a higher operating temperature and hotspots on the leave
exceeding 98 degrees

This next picture shows a happy plant underneath the Gaia 8 with a
maximum temperature 6 degrees cooler.  These two plants are in the same
room but just under their respective lights.

And here you can see that the light itself operates at about 111 degrees
