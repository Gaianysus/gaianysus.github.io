The Gaia-8s is an advanced light composed of 8 90 Watt high intensity COB LEDs
and 96 5 Watt spectrum LEDs.  Which gives a full spectrum of light
that includes lot's of blue to keep your plants from getting too 'leggy'
<img src="/img/thumbs/gaia-8s.png" alt="Gaia-8s" class="wideimg" style="float: left; margin: 15px 15px 15px 15px;">
and plenty of red to make your blooms dense and fragrant.
The concentration is on the spectrums your plant absorbs and not the
frequencies it reflects. This means less energy is wasted on light the plant does
not use for photosynthesis and you waste less electricity on producing
light frequencies your plant will never use.

The main difference between the 8s and 8 is a tighter footprint
concentrating the light that your plant receives.

The COB LED is a relatively new offering in the field of light emitting
diodes (LEDs), they the Chip-on-Board (COB).  These are arrays of LEDs
(typically 9 or more) that are clustered very closely together.  Then
they are passed through a diffuser to evenly distribute the light,
finally a reflector and a lens orient the light in the right direction
to give your plants as much red and blue light as possible.

The 96 5 watt LEDs give a good even full spectrum of light to make sure
that your plan receives everything the sun provides.  This comlements
the extreme red and blue light given off from the COBs.

With a 4' x 6' coverage area you are able to produce the gnarliest buds ever.

We recommend spacing 6 plants evenly in your area, fed with our [Roots N Shoots](/RootsNShoots/) fertilizer
during the first 6 weeks of their lives

<img src="/img/thumbs/persephone.png" alt="Persephone" class="wideimg" style="float: left; margin: 15px 15px 15px 15px;">
Then during Bloom try our [Persephone Boost](/RootsNShoots)
to really kick things up a notch.

Once you are in the bloom phase you need to change up the nutrient blend
to give the plant everything it needs to produce dense and fragrant
buds.

### Key Features

1. Powerful Results, bigger, denser, more fragrant buds.

1. Power Efficiency Lowers Electricity Bills

2. Fully adjustable spectrum allows you to  customize the
   spectrum that your light is receiving.  This helps in vegetative
   growth with more blue light to prevent your plant from getting too
   leggy and tall.  And during bloom we give lot's for better bud
   production, this enhances tripene, and trichome production during
   your late stages to make your buds the most fragrant and powerful.

8. Having a 4' x 6' extremely wide footprint eliminates the problems
   many other LEDs have had issues with.  With a larger footprint than
<img src="/img/TopVR.jpg" alt="Top VR" class="wideimg" style="float: left; margin: 5px 25px 5px 10px;">
   the HID and HPS setups, better light penetration of the canopy.
   End the days of popcorn nugs.

5. The Gaia-8s uses 750 Watts which is 25% less than a 1000 Watt
conventional lamp. In addition the LED lights run much cooler
and do not require as much ventilation and cooling.
The savings over time would be substantial,
and provides 21,050 lumens of light and 56,712 Lux
at 30cm, but the real figure is photosynthetically active radiation (PAR)
and the Gaia-8s provides a whopping 1560
(&micro;mol/m<sup>2</sup>s).
This is adjustable in case you need to use less light.

### Chips On Board (COB)

One of the prominent features of the Gaia-8s is the two rows of four COB
LEDs.

COB LEDs package many LEDs together behind a diffuser focused by a lens
all in a single package.  This is the cutting edge in LED technology:
you get powerful light from an extremely power efficient package.

First many LEDs are package together in a singe tiny space.  This
permits many LEDs to work together to bring the overall output of light
up. Then it is passed through a diffuser to evenly distribute the light
to prevent any hard edges.  Next it is focused through a lens that
nets us a cone of light we can direct towards our photosynthesizing
plant. Finally, a tiny reflector is added to the package to all available
light is directed to the plant.

In the end we get a single light source that is capable of producing
over 150 lm/watt, and it does it evenly over an area without glare and
hotspots.

## [DormGrow](http://www.dormgrow.com/ledvshid) - LED vs HID

One of the biggest advantages to growing with LEDs as compared to
growing with High Intensity Discharge (HID) bulbs such as High Pressure
Sodium (HPS) and Metal Halide (MH) bulbs is the fact that LEDs consume a
fraction of the electricity; as much as 70% less. Another advantage of
LEDs is their near zero heat signature. LED grow lights give off less
than 10% of the heat that a high intensity discharge bulb such as high
pressure sodium (HPS) or metal halide (MH) bulbs do. Less energy
consumption and less heat go hand in hand as the majority of the wasted
electricity in HID systems is given off as heat. If you have ever grown
with HID systems you have experienced the problem of excess heat which
must be mitigated by venting and air conditioning systems. LED Grow
Lights eliminate this problem completely. After being on for 24 hours,
the LED grow light is only slightly warm and cool enough to touch.

## Photosynthetic Action Spectrum - PAR

<img src="/img/Indoor1.jpg" alt="Indoor1" class="wideimg" style="float: left; margin: 5px 15px 5px 15px;">

LED Grow lights are made up of individual diodes that are focused to
specific wavelengths of the light spectrum necessary for plant
photosynthesis. A light bulb gives off white light which encompasses all
the colors of the visible light spectrum. Plant photosynthesis requires
only specific wavelengths of light and all the extra wavelengths that
are in white   light are wasted. LED grow light diodes have a blend of
only the wavelengths that are needed in the correct ratios necessary for
photosynthesis. These wavelengths are mainly the reds, oranges and blues
in the 580-630nm and 420-470nm ranges. G8LED grow lights have gone
through several iterations to formulate the optimal blend of diode ratio
best suited for indoor growing based on the photosynthetic action
radiation necessary for plant growth.

Growing with LED grow lights is the way to Grow Green! It is the most
efficient method of providing a light source necessary for plant
photosynthesis. With all the benefits that come with LEDs it is no
wonder why more and more growers are adding LED grow lights to their
grow rooms.


Growing with LEDs is more economical than growing with bulbs. With LEDs
there is no need for a ballast as you can plug the growlight directly
into the wall outlet. Furthermore, there is less need for venting and
air conditioning systems. Because LEDs last up to 100 times longer than
bulbs, there is no need to replace a bulb ever. To protect your LED grow
<img src="/img/AbsorptionSpectra300.jpg" alt="Absorption Spectra" class="wideimg" style="float: left; margin: 5px 15px 5px 15px;">
light, connect it to a power stabilizer. The power stabilizer will
regulate the voltage coming from your power box and eliminate various
power fluctuations which can damage devices. If too many high wattage
devices are connected to the same circuit there can be voltage
fluctuations which damage power drivers inside which power the diodes.
This is especially true for growers who use solar energy to power their
grow rooms since these systems tend to have power spikes and surges. A
power stabilizer is an inexpensive way to protect your grow lights to
ensure there is no down time during critical stages of growth. LED grow
lights will give you tremendous electrical savings and will reduce
operational costs, providing savings month after month. Upgrade your
grow room and Grow Green with G8LED technology.

## Light Stats

#### Eletrical Characteristics

The Gaia-8s includes one master switch to turn the light on or off completely, and three separate dimmers to change the intensity of the Red, Blue, and Hight Intensity LEDs individually so you can fine tune for cloning, vegetative, and flowering stages. An auto switching powersupply is integrated which should be suitable for most power applications. A 90 degree optical glass lens focuses the light coming out of the unit enhancing penetration ensuring quality photosynthesis.  If the unit overheats (>60C) it will shut off automatically.

#### Warnings!
Indoor use only.  Avoid getting the unit wet in any way.  It
should be mounted well above any irrigation equipment.  The plants
should not be less than 10 inches from the light or you risk burning the
plant, but it should not be more than 30 inches from the top of your
plants.  The plants should also be misted 2-3 times every day.
